About Project : Cab rides paint a vibrant picture of life in the city. The millions of rides taken each month can
provide insight into traffic patterns, road blockage, or large-scale events that attract many people. With ride
sharing apps gaining popularity, it is increasingly important for cab companies to provide visibility to their
estimated fare since the competing apps provide these metrics upfront. Predicting fare of a ride can help
passengers decide when is the optimal time to start their commute, or help drivers decide which of two
potential rides will be more profitable, for example. Furthermore, this visibility into fare will attract
customers during times when ridesharing services are implementing surge pricing. In order to predict fare,
only data which would be available at the beginning farid was used.
    This includes pick up and drop off coordinates, trip distance, start time, number of passengers.
Regression models were used to predict fare amount. Now it becomes really important to manage their data
properly to come up with new business ideas to get best results. In this scenario, earn most revenues. So, it
becomes really important estimate the fare prices accurately
